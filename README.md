## 👋 Hi, I'm Kevin King!
AI Researcher | Machine Learning Engineer | Human-AI Interaction Enthusiast

🚀 I specialize in **human-centered AI**, **multimodal learning**, and **real-time behavior modeling** — building intelligent systems that sense, adapt to, and collaborate with people. My work blends machine learning, affective computing, and neuroadaptive technology across simulations, telehealth, and robotics.

## 🔍 Currently exploring:

* **Emotion-aware AI** for healthcare, collaboration, and learning
* **AI for behavior-adaptive simulations** (AR/VR/Desktop)
* **LLMs + multimodal input** for interactive autonomous agents
* **Reinforcement learning** in mixed human-agent teams
