## 👋 Hi, I'm Kevin King!
AI Researcher | Machine Learning Engineer | Human-AI Interaction Enthusiast

🚀 Passionate about AI-driven behavioral modeling, multimodal learning, and human-computer interaction, I specialize in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and AI applications in AR/VR. My work focuses on building AI-powered tools for behavioral analysis, human-agent collaboration, and interactive experiences.

## 🔍 Currently exploring:

- AI-driven AR/VR simulations and player behavior analysis
- AI for emotion-aware computing and multimodal learning (audio, video, text)
- Generative AI & LLMs for code analysis and autonomous agents
- Reinforcement learning applied to human-agent collaboration

## 🛠️ Projects
